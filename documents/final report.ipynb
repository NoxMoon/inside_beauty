    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be hard to find the right beauty product, so many choices... Although there are a lot of reviews available, people can have different skin types, and usually one won’t know whether she/he likes a product until having tried it for a while. If we are buying a product, hoping it can “do something” instead of just looking for a psychological effect, it’s probably useful to take a look at its formula. With that, this project is focused on answering the following two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. How important is product formula in determining a beauty product’s price?\n",
    "The price of beauty product varies a lot. There is always a debate on whether it is worthwhile to invest on expensive skin cares or makeups. While this could be a matter of personal belief, customers may be curious to know where their money goes for. Is a product expensive because it has sophisticated ingredients, or because it has attractive packaging, or simply because it is from a high-end brand.\n",
    "In this project, we build a regression model to predict a product’s price, and to investigate whether it is the ingredients or other factors that matter the most in determining the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Given a product’s ingredient list, can we more or less know its category?\n",
    "The cosmetic companies certainly never stop coming up with new concepts. Apart from a \"face cream\", we now have toner, serum, masks, face oil, eye cream, or even mask primer. I have been wondering why people would like to use eye creams: is the skin around eye somehow different from the skin of the rest of the face, and does eye cream has some special ingredients to accommodate that? If not, why would one want to buy an eye cream that is usually of the same price as a face cream but half in size? \n",
    "I am curious to see to what extent machine learning can distinguish the category a product belongs to just by looking at its ingredients. Are all different categories really designed for different uses or do they exist simply because of the marketing strategy of cosmetic companies? This can help people understand the cosmetic products like a chemist and simplify their skin care routine if desired."

    "### Ingredient Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Different companies may list the same ingredient in different ways. The most common ingredient water, can appear as “water”, “water (aqua)”, “Water/Aqua/Eau”, “purified water”… in different products. Some companies also like to list ingredient’s function in brackets, such as “Cocamidopropyl Betaine (cleansing)”. To reduce sparsity of the ingredient features and make use of ingredient information in the ingredient dictionary dataset we obtained, we tried to match all ingredients to the 1750 existing ingredients. We used the SequenceMatcher from python difflib package for this purpose. The basic idea of SequenceMatcher tries to find the longest continuous matching subsequence that is “junk free” (without e.g. space). SequenceMatcher returns a value between 0 and 1 that can serve as similarity metric between two strings. The matching results tend to “look right” to people but not necessarily be the one with minimal edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample matching results:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ingredient_matching.png\" width=\"900\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "SequenceMatch provides overall satisfactory matching results with mistakes occasionally. For example, in the above sample matching results, lactic acid is mistakenly matched to acetic acid, zea mays (corn germ) oil is matched to wheat germ oil. Currently, we set a threshold of 0.25 and ingredients with match metric below that will be labelled as unknown ingredients. With 16985 unique ingredients in all three product dataframes, there are only 23 unmatched ingredients. Thus, potentially we have room to increase the threshold of matching to reduce falsely matched cases, although it would still be hard to deal with cases of similar name but very different ingredient pairs such as lactic acid and acetic acid, or Green 6 (a pigment) and green tea. In addition, considering we have ~8000 products and each product typically has ~20 ingredients, it seems that the products share a lot of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Cleaning and Feature Engineering\n",
    "#### Drop categories.\n",
    "We are not going to study products that are not \"chemical\" products, like makeup brushes, cleaning devices.\n",
    "#### Merge some categories. \n",
    "This allows us to have larger categories, so that we are able to have meaningful modelling with reasonable data size.\n",
    "* Merge \"Eyes\", \"Eye Cream & Treatment\", 'Eye Masks\"\n",
    "* Merge \"Face & Body Sunscreen\", \"Water-Resistant Sunscreen\", \"Sunscreen\"\n",
    "* Merge \"Makeup Remover\", \"Cleansers\", \"Face Wipes\"\n",
    "* Merge \"Lips\", \"Lip Balm\", \n",
    "* Merge \"AHA Exfoliant\", \"BHA Exfoliant\", \"Scrubs\", \"Exfoliants\"\n",
    "* Merge \"Lipstick\", \"Lip Gloss\", \"Lip Liner\"\n",
    "* Merge \"Eyeshadow Palette\", \"Eyeshadow\"\n",
    "* Merge \"Waterproof Mascara\", \"Mascara\"\n",
    "* Merge \"Foundation Without Sunscreen\", \"Foundation With Sunscreen\", \"Foundation\", \"BB & CC Cream\", \"Tinted Moisturizer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Split \"size\" column to a number and unit, do unit conversion as necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compute \"average price\"\n",
    "It may also be interesting to look at per size price. Some categories can be much expensive when considering the size, such as eye creams, which are typically half size of face moisturizers with similar price range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ingredients related features\n",
    "There are two kinds of ingredients: \"inactive\" and \"active\". Inactive ingredients are general ingredients and active ingredients are usually special-functional ingredients such as sunscreen agent. It would be helpful to seperately count these two types of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "After matching all the ingredients to the ingredient dictionary, we are able to compute quite a number of features:\n",
    "* Number of ingredients of a certain rating (how many ingredient rated as Good/Average etc.)\n",
    "* Number of ingredients belongs to a certain category (how many antioxidants/sunscreen etc.)\n",
    "* Average or weighted rating. For products that list ingredients in descending order of their quantity, we can give ingredients different weights based on their position in the list.\n",
    "* Count some special categories of ingredients. For example, peptides, ingredients called \"xxx extract\"...\n",
    "* Finally we can make a giant binary matrix indicating all ingredients' presense in each product. We may need dimensionality reduction techniques to preprocess these features for some machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Preprocessing and Logo Image Filtering\n",
    "We preprocessed all images to size 128 * 128. Some products on Beautypedia do not have real product photos but a logo of the brand. We build a simple classifier trained on hand picked small data set (with 104 logo samples and 283 non-logo samples) to filter these log images. In a sample of predictions, we got 6% false positives and 1% false negatives. We kept 6324 unique non-logo images.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed graphical EDA can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/NoxMoon/inside_beauty/blob/master/eda/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb). We explored the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Unique products\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, products belongs to multiple categories are stored in multiple rows. For example, in skin care, there are 5105 rows and 4810 unique products, with 4535 products belongs to a single category.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Makeups are more likely to have missing ingredient information, especially in categories such as lipstick and mascara, which people care less about the ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Number of products by category\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest category nighttime moisturizer has 1000+ products. Categories like retinol, skin lightener, body wash, eyeshadow primer have less than 50 products.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Number of products by brand\n",
    "\n",
    "Brand is highly cardinal: there are 224 skin care brands, 107 body care brands and 132 makeup brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Price v.s. category\n",
    "\n",
    "In general skin cares can be most expensive, body cares are cheapest, makeups are in the middle. Price is typically right skewed.\n",
    "![](images/price_all.png)\n",
    "Most expensive category is serum (highest median price), cheap categories includes cleanser, lip balm, mascara…\n",

    "<img src=\"images/price_category_bodycare.png\" width=\"700\" />\n",
    "<img src=\"images/price_category_makeup.png\" width=\"700\" />\n",
    "####  Price v.s. brand\n",
    "\n",
    "Price varies a lot with brand. Products from expensive brands can easily cost \\$200, while brands such as wet’n wide, Colourpop have affordable products below 10 bucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/price_brand_skincare.png\" width=\"700\" />\n",
    "<img src=\"images/price_brand_bodycare.png\" width=\"700\" />\n",
    "<img src=\"images/price_brand_makeup.png\" width=\"700\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price v.s. ingredient\n",
    "There is no single metric to evaluate a product's formula. However, we can start with examine some simple assumptions:\n",
    "1. Price is related to the number of ingredients in a product --- if a product contains a long list of product, it may be more likely that the company has spend some time on this sophisticated formula and the product might be expensive.\n",
    "2. Price is related to the quality of ingredients, expensive products may contain more skin-beneficial ingredients such as antioxidant. Since we have rated the ingredient using the ingredient dictionary on Paula's choice website, we can compute the average rating of each product and see if it is related to the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make scatter plots to get the initial idea of whether there is a correlation between price and number of ingredients or ingredient rating.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/price_ingredient_skincare.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "<img src=\"images/price_ingredient_bodycare.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "<img src=\"images/price_ingredient_makeup.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "There seem to be a trend (although not very strong) that products with more ingredients are more expensive in skin care products. This trend is not clear in body care and makeups, which makes sense: people usually don't expect body care products to have functions such as anti-aging, pore-reducing, anti-acne, etc like for skin cares. It may be more important for a body care product to smell good and have some basic hydration effect, and that does not need a lot of ingredients. For makeups, people may care more about the packaging, whether the color suit..., again these concerns are not strongly related to ingredient.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the scatter plots, we don't see a strong correlation between average ingredient rating and product price, even for skin care products. Also, it seems like more ingredient doesn't mean \"good\" ingredient. However, we haven't consider ingredient's quantity in products. Also, we cannot garantee that our ingredient rating is scientifically correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price v.s. ingredient category\n",
    "We examined the correlation between price and different ingredient categories using the the pearson correlation between price and the count of ingredient for each category in products. We identified the top categories with highest correlation with price:\n",
    "In skin care: Skin-Restoring, Texture Enhancer, Antioxidants, Emollients, Skin-Replenishing.\n",
    "In body care: Antioxidants, Plant Extracts, Skin-Restoring, Hydration, Fragrance.\n",
    "In makeups: Plant Extracts, Skin-Replenishing, Antioxidants, Skin-Restoring, Sensitizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "People would hope that these categories of ingredients are also the good ingredients. By ranking the ingredient based on their averge rating (table below), we can see that some categories that highly correlated with price, such as antioxidants, skin-restoring, emollients are also \"good\" categories, while categories such as fragrance and sensitizing ingredients are actually not good for skin --- they might be there to make products more pleasant to use.\n",

In text data, people often set an upper bound (\"max_df\") and a lower bound (\"min_df\") while counting words, we may also consider doing that while selecting features. \"min_df\" should be when the curve starts to increase steeply, \"max_df\" should be when the curve starts to become flat.\n",

In addition, we conduct pairwise t-test on top six brand/category to compare their price. We can visualize the p-values with heatmaps. The color encodes the logorithm of p-values when comparing the average price of two brands/categories. Red block indicates the row group is more expensive than the column group, blue indicates that row group is cheaper than the column group.  Also, darker color means the two brand/category is easy to tell apart (distinguishable), while near-white blocks are where there is no statistical significant. From the heatmap, it is clear to see that serums are the most expensive among the six categories and lip products are the cheapest. Also, Clarins and Shiseido are the most expensive brands of the six, and hard to distinguish among themselves, Neutrogena is the cheapest.\n",

    "#### Slope test for number of ingredients\n",
    "In the EDA we have done earlier, we found price seem to be positively correlated with number of ingredient, and the effect is stronger in skin care products. We will examine the statistic significance using slope tests (t-test on slopes) on the number of ingredient.\n",

It could be the case of small practical significance but large statistical significance. The r-values are small, so the underlining correlation may be buried under large variance. Also, the number of active ingredient in skin care is negatively correlated with price, the reason might be that the products containing active ingredient such as sunscreens are cheaper categories.\n",

    "We apply stope test for average rating of inactive and active ingredients, and two different weighted rating of inactive ingredients (w1: reciprocal weight of ingredient position in list, w2: exponential decay with ingredient postion in list). From the statistic test, we see that the rating for inactive ingredients do has statistical significance with price, which is not obvious on the rating-price scatter plot we have in EDA earlier. Again, it could be the case of small practical significance but large statistical significance, the slopes are large (meaning the fitted lines are almost vertical), and for makeup and body care, the slopes are negative.\n",

    "### tSNE with ingredient features\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing supervised learning to predict product categories, we attempted to run some tSNE plots with ingredient features, and see if products belonging to the same category come close together in tSNE plot. It turns out it's not easy to separate different categories in a tSNE plot. The reason may be that there are too much noise with all the ingredient count. Those ingredient that are less relevant to product category contribute equally to the tSNE model, making it hard to reveal the pattern related to product category. However, after pruning individuel ingredients (by choosing ingredients with high chi2 statistics with category) and add other ingredient-related features such as count and rating, we are able to see a vague cluster of cleansers (red dots), and a cluster which is mostly a mixture of sunscreen and daytime moisturizer (purple and brown dots):\n",
    "\n",
    "![tsne](images/tsne.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the tSNE plot looks quite noisy. Eye creams, nighttime moisturizer and serums tend to mix together, which may not be a surprise as they are similar after all. We would want to do supervised learning to see if we can distiguish product category further.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product category classification with ingredient features\n",
    "\n",
    "We attempted to predict a product's category using only ingredient related features. This can provide us insight over which categories are similar in their formula and and help people understand chemical aspect of cosmetic products. It will be a multilabel classification problem as a product may belong to multiple categories, for example [\"Even Skin Vitamin C Cream\"](https://www.trishmcevoy.com/p-108-even-skin-vitamin-c-cream.aspx) from brand Trish McEvoy is both nighttime moisturizer and vitamin C product. We can do one vs rest classification to tackle the multilabel problem. Scikit-learn's OneVsRestClassifier is the perfect wrapper for this job. It can take any regular classifier as estimator to do one vs rest classification for each class under the hood and return the prediction for all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ingredients are like the words in documents, thus many techniques people use for text data can be applied here. We can create a \"bag of ingredients\" matrix, where the matrix elements are binary indicators of whether a certain ingredient exists in a certain product. As in text data, Naive Bayes can be a good baseline model. In this case, we can use Bernoulli Naive Bayes to deal with binary ingredient features. In addition, we also have ingredient category available in after finding the matching ingredients in the ingredient dictionary. Thus, we can have \"bag of ingredient categories\" features that counts how many ingredients of an ingredient category are in a product. These features can be used with Multinomial Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the count features and binary features, there are also some general ingredient features that could potentially be useful, such as number of ingredients. We can make use of these features though model stacking: the naive bayes models will serve as first layer models, then the predicted probabilities can be joined with general ingredient features to feed in the final model.\n",
    "The training pipeline is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![flow_chart](images/product_category_flow_chart.png)\n",

    "The Bernoulli Naive Bayes serves as a good baseline model. It achieves 0.3724 Hamming score on training set with cross validation, and 0.3588 on test set. The auc (area under curve) score for all 16 categories are larger than 0.78. Also, it is straight forward to use Bernoulli Naive Bayes to identify the key ingredients that are mostly associated with each category. This is done by predicting on individual ingredient (\"hypothetical\" products with just one ingredient, the feature matrix will be an identity matrix with dimension N_ingredient). The results makes sense in general, we are able to identify:\n",

    "#### Multinomial Naive Bayes with ingredient category count features\n",
    "We achieved 0.2707 Hamming score using ingredient categories alone. The results is not good enough by itself, but the predictions can be useful features for the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Prediction with LightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "We stacked general ingredient features (number of ingredient, average/weighted rating of ingredients in products) and the predictions of the above two models to train the final model. The final model is based on gradient boost decision tree with lightgbm package. The final Hamming score is 0.4837 for cross-validation on training set and 0.5111 on test set, which is a significant improvement compare to Naive Bayes. We also improved the auc score of 10 product categories. We do note that there are five categories that the final more complicated model cannot beat naive bays: cleansers, exfoliants, face mask, serum and toner.\n",

We tweeked the definition of confusion matrix for multilabel classification, cases when true classes are both A and B and the model predicts B won't count as false positive in the (A,B) element.\n",

    "Overall, the results do agree with our life experience. The model gets confused on similar categories. For example, daytime moisturizers often have sunscreen ingredients in it, so sometimes our model cannot distiguish sunscreens and daytime moisturizer. Nighttime moisturizer, eye creams and serum are another group that our model get confused a lot in real life, they are all products that are supposed boost hydration and may have some special functions such as anti-aging, reduce hyperpigmentation... It is interesting to see that face masks got confused with cleansers, Exfoliants, and nighttime moisturizer. This is because there are typically two types of face masks: cleansing mask, which may have similar ingredient like cleansers and exfoliants. Another is the so called \"sleeping mask\", which you can wear overnight, they are typically like a heavy nighttime moisturizer.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "We have seen our machine learning model can more or less predict the category of a cosmetic product just using the ingredient information. It is able to associate surfactant with cleanser, coloring agents/pigment with lipsticks, AHA(alpha hydroxy acid) or BHA(beta hydroxy acid) with exfoliator, sunscreen agents with daytime moisturizers and sunscreen products... Our model also helps us identify categories that are similar ingredient-wise, such as eye creams, moisturizers and serums. Based on the machine learning results, it would make more sense for a customer to use a sleeping mask as a nighttime moisturizer, but it would not be wise to use foundation as sunscreens.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the EDA we have done, we do see some ingredient categories that positively correlated with price are the \"good\" categories according to beautypedia's expert rating, which is reassuring. But also keep in mind that things like fragrance are also making products expensive, not because it is good to the skin, but because it makes the product pleasant to use. In the price regression, we found ingredient features do have predictive power in determining price, although not as powerful as factors such as brand and product category currently. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do note there are several limitations in the current model. For example, currently our model is not doing well in classify toners, while in reality, people can easily tell apart a toner based on its texture. The limitation stems from the lacking of quantity information in the ingredient lists. If we know the percentage of water in a product, we can probably do better in distinguishing toners and other products. In the future, we may work on the following aspects to further improve the current model:\n",
    "* Explore other methods for ingredient matching, such as algorithms based Levenshtein distance.\n",
    "* Finding more data from other resourses can help improve the models. Currently, many brands and categories do not have enough products. \n",
    "* Improve the price prediction using product images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I want to say that while I believe understanding the formula of cosmetic products and having a knowledge of what's inside the products can make people more rational while spending their money, and have a realistic expectation in the products, I also think it is totally fine to buy products not for need, but for fun!"
