Despite claims being made for acetyl hexapeptide-8 (argireline), there is a clinical study revealing that this ingredient is not even remotely as effective as dermatological procedures in reducing signs of aging.  Other studies on topical use of a moisturizer containing a 10% concentration of acetyl hexapeptide-8 have shown it does not penetrate beyond the uppermost layers of skin, even after several hours. That means it cannot affect factors in the underlying layers that lead to the formation of expression lines.   On the other hand, research has shown this peptide can penetrate further into skin if specific formulary steps are followed, including the type of emulsion (a higher water content showed greater penetration). However, even then the peptide wasn’t showing results equivalent to cosmetic corrective procedures.   Still, like all peptides, acetyl hexapeptide-8 has water-binding properties and skin-restoring ability.

36,                    advanced glycation endproduct (AGE)                ,"Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are destructive substances generated in the body when we consume refined sugars and due to environmental exposure without adequate protection. But first, a bit of backstory…  One of the more depressing skincare facts we can think of is how bad dietary sugar or high glycemic index foods (foods that turn to sugar almost immediately after eating them) are for almost every aspect of your skin. Chocolate cake, honey-drenched sweets, ice cream sundaes, bread pudding, and on and on (and we could go on and on) cause very bad things to happen to skin. UV light and air pollutants are attacking your skin from the outside in, and sugar is attacking it from the inside out.  What’s the relationship between sugar and AGEs? Sugars quickly and strongly bind to proteins in the skin (proteins are the main building blocks of skin) forming AGEs that progressively and continually destroy many aspects of skin, especially elastin and collagen, the two substances that give skin its firmness and resilience. Once generated, AGEs begin a cascade of progressive damage that isn’t easy to stop or reverse.  Research has also shown AGEs can cause abnormal melanin production that leads to the formation of brown spots and mottled skin discolorations. Another ironic acronym for this is RAGEs, meaning a receptor site for AGEs that induces unhealthy melanin production.  Although sugar is certainly a major culprit in the skin-damaging creation of AGEs, so is something called the Maillard Reaction (MR). The Maillard Reaction is what happens when you cook any food and brown or blacken it with high heat. That means steaming or sautéing food without browning is far healthier for your skin and body. And chargrilling foods, especially meats, at high heat is even worse! Our apologies to those who prefer their steaks well done.  While some skincare companies claim their products contain ingredients that can block AGEs from forming, that benefit hasn’t been supported anywhere in the research. In the meantime, while science is working on this insidious problem, eating a low sugar diet that’s rich in antioxidants, complex carbohydrates, and omega fatty acids is by far the best approach for younger-looking, healthy skin from the inside out (and when you put those ingredients on your skin it can help from the outside in too, it’s just not clear how much that helps control the visible effects of AGEs; however, a huge amount of research shows those ingredients to be beneficial for skin overall).  What about the occasional sweet treat? Although we can’t change what eating refined sugars does to your skin (and yes, this includes so-called sugar substitutes like raw honey and agave nectar, both of which the body recognizes as simple sugars), we also realize that sweets play a role in the pleasures of eating and celebrating. The trick is to keep it in moderation, meaning an occasional, judicious indulgence rather than daily consumption of desserts, sugary sodas, and flavored coffee drinks, the latter of which can contain an alarming amount of sugars.

AHAs are derived naturally from various plant sources and from milk, but 99% of the AHAs used in cosmetics are synthetically derived. In low concentrations (less than 3%), AHAs work as water-binding agents. At concentrations greater than 4% and in a base with an acid pH of 3 to 4, these ingredients can exfoliate by breaking down the substance that holds dead skin together.  The most effective and well-researched AHAs are glycolic acid and lactic acid. Malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid may also be effective.  AHAs may sensitize mucous membranes. However, AHAs have been widely used for improving signs of aging, dry skin and an uneven skin tone, all of which lead to younger-looking skin.  There is a vast amount of research that substantially describes how the aging process affects skin and that demonstrates that many of the unwanted changes can be improved by topical application of AHAs, including glycolic and lactic acids. AHA use can result in increased sensitivity to the sun, though wearing a sunscreen daily eliminates this risk.  Note: AHAs are of little benefit when added to rinse-off products, as their contact with skin is too brief for them to function as exfoliants or absorb into skin.

50,                    alcohol                ,"""Alcohol"" refers to a group of organic compounds with a vast range of forms and uses in cosmetics and in other types of products and solutions.   For skin, there are good alcohols and bad alcohols, corresponding to high-molecular-weight alcohols and low-molecular-weight alcohols, respectively, which can have emollient properties (cetyl alcohol) or act as detergent cleansing agents like isopropanol.   There also are benign forms, including glycols, which are used as humectants to help hydrate and deliver ingredients into skin’s uppermost layers.  Alcohols with low molecular weights—the bad-for-skin kind—can be drying and sensitizing. The alcohols to be concerned about in skincare products are ethanol or ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl alcohol. The concern is when one or more of these are listed among the main ingredients; tiny amounts in an otherwise good formula aren’t a problem.  In addition to being drying and sensitizing, these alcohols can disrupt skin’s surface layers. Alcohol helps ingredients like retinol and vitamin C penetrate into the skin more effectively, but it does that by breaking down the surface layers of skin—destroying the very substances that keep your skin feeling healthier and looking younger over the long term.  Alcohols like SD and ""denatured"" immediately harm the skin, starting a chain reaction of damage that continues long after it has evaporated. A 2003 study published found that with regular exposure to alcohol-based products, cleansing becomes a damaging ordeal—skin is no longer able to keep water and cleansing agents from penetrating into it, thus further eroding its surface layers.  It also destroyed the substances in skin that help to naturally soothe and defend it against visible effects of environmental damage.  If that weren’t bad enough, exposure to alcohol causes healthy substances in skin to literally self-destruct. The research also showed that these destructive, aging effects on skin’s substances increased the longer the exposure to alcohol; that is, two days of exposure was dramatically more harmful than one day, and that is only from exposure to a 3% concentration (most skincare products with denatured alcohol contain greater amounts than that).  In short, for the healthy appearance of skin at any age, avoiding products that contain high amounts of the drying, sensitizing types of alcohol is a non-negotiable skincare must.

It's also a common source of confusion in terms of its presence in cosmetics, specifically whether that presence poses a health risk. The fact is, when you read ""aluminum"" on an ingredient list, it isn't pure aluminum—not even close.Pure aluminum is not added to any skincare or makeup product. Rather, compounds (mixtures of aluminum), such as aluminum combined with other natural elements, are safety used in a variety of ways in personal care products, foods and medicines. These compounds contain only traces of aluminum, and in daily use over the long term are perfectly safe. Such ingredients actually contain less aluminum than what occurs naturally in plants, vegetables or even in the human body).Here are a few examples of the most common aluminum compounds used as ingredients in cosmetics, and a brief description of what they are (as well as their global safety status).aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum chloride contain only trace quantities of pure aluminum. These are most commonly used in antiperspirant and deodorants (and some medications) with extensive safety records.alumina is also not ""aluminum,"" but rather a combination of minerals that contain various mixtures of aluminum, silica, chloride or zirconium and oxygen. It is also known as ""aluminum oxide"" or ""aluminum hydroxide,"" and is used safely in cosmetics, medicines and medical devices.magnesium aluminum silicate is refined from clay and often used as an absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It is unable to penetrate skin.aluminum starch is made from a reaction of a plant-derived ingredient (starch), and often used as a thickening or absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It has an extensive safety record. In cosmetics, the minute quantities of aluminum present in such ingredients are not at risk of absorption, as it these ingredients are insoluble—they are physically incapable of absorption into the body. This is true of such ingredients, whether they are used in cosmetics or skincare/personal care products.In fact, skin does not readily absorb cosmetic ingredients. It's actually quite challenging to penetrate the skin's outer layers with skincare or medical products—such formulas must be specifically engineered to allow ingredients to penetrate even the most superficial layer of skin.Thus, aluminum or aluminum ingredients do not contribute to health risks, and a link otherwise has not been established. Quite the opposite, as the Mayo Clinic, The World Health Organization, the European Union and the FDA have all concurred that there is no linkage of aluminum in personal care products to other health risks.Published literature and an overwhelming amount of research has shown that skin cannot absorb aluminum from these ingredients, and what is used is far less than what we are exposed to daily in the food and water (given aluminum is a natural element that's present all around us—whether we use products with aluminum ingredients or not). "

It is a potent antioxidant and skin-soothing agent that can improve the appearance of signs of aging.Ascorbic acid is also a powerhouse when mixed with other antioxidants, or when used alone in higher concentrations, such as 15% or 20% or greater, amounts that can be great for evening out skin tone.A particularly vulnerable antioxidant when exposed to UV light and air, ascorbic acid must be packaged to protect it from these elements during routine use, or its effectiveness will gradually become diminished to the point of not working at all (you will see this as oxidized discoloration, meaning the product turns a copper to brownish color). For this reason, avoid any vitamin C (ascorbic acid) products packaged in jars.What about using vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and niacinamide in the same product or applied at the same time in separate products? You might have read or heard that niacinamide and vitamin C shouldn’t be used at the same time, whether found together in the same product or applied separately one after the other. Rest assured, this combination is fine and is in fact quite beneficial! The research this misconception is based on was conducted in the 1960s; the forms of niacinamide and vitamin C used in this study were not stabilized—although niacinamide itself is very stable. The base of the formula used in this study was also far different than today’s sophisticated skincare formulas.  Today, cosmetic chemists know how to combine niacinamide and vitamin C in the ideal base formulas that enhance their compatibility. The other common concern we’ve seen about combining these two ingredients has to do with the pH range. The concern is that the acidic environment ascorbic acid needs to be most effective will cause niacinamide will convert to nicotinic acid, a form that can be sensitizing, possibly inducing redness. Good news: This conversion process would only happen under conditions of the formula being exposed to very high heat for a long period of time. This would not apply to layering skincare products or to heat conditions that occur during manufacturing, transport, and storage of cosmetic products that contain niacinamide and ascorbic acid.  What all of this means is that you can use or layer products containing both niacinamide and vitamin C knowing that they will not render each other any less effective. Each of these ingredients on its own can help to address dark spots, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, loss of firmness, and dullness. When used together, they become even more of a powerhouse! This duo will help give you an even better chance at achieving a radiant, smooth, even, younger-looking complexion.References for this information:Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, January 2012, issue 1, pages 51-56AAPS PharmSciTech, September 2011, issue 3, pages 917-923Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, September 2008, issue 3, pages 418-425Dermatologic Surgery, July 2005, issue 7, part 2, pages 814-817Dermatologic Surgery, February 2001, issue 2, pages 137-142"

Research on ascorbyl glucoside’s ability to improve uneven skin tone or spots isn’t too exciting, at least compared with more studied types of vitamin C; however ascorbyl glucoside plus the B vitamin niacinamide is a viable combination to consider, and several skincare products pair these ingredients.  Ascorbyl glucoside is a good form of vitamin C to consider, though as with any ingredient, skin will reap greater benefits from a mix of great ingredients rather than focusing on just one, hoping it does it all.

Although betaine salicylate appears to be promising, there’s no independent research to go on, and no independent studies comparing its effectiveness to the well-established BHA ingredient salicylic acid.The only research about betaine salicylate comes from Arch Personal Care Products, an ingredient manufacturer that sells this ingredient. According to their information based on in vivo testing, betaine salicylate shows comparable effectiveness to salicylic acid at double the concentration. So, in seems that in order to get the same results from betaine salicylate as a product with 2% salicylic acid, a 4% concentration of betaine salicylate is necessary.Interestingly, like salicylic acid, betaine salicylate’s effectiveness is pH-dependent, with a pH range of 3.8-4.2 being needed.Anecdotal information from consumers who’ve tried products with betaine salicylate and salicylic acid is mixed; some people report better results and tolerability with betaine salicylate, while others report that salicylic acid worked better, without any unwanted effects. Our advice? Unless you know your skin cannot tolerate or doesn’t respond well to leave-on exfoliants with salicylic acid, there’s little reason to seek out an exfoliant with betaine salicylate. However, if you live in a country where salicylic acid’s use in skincare is unusually restricted, betaine salicylate exfoliants are worth checking out, but be sure the concentration is at least 4%."

Some cosmetic companies claim that bismuth oxychloride is natural and better for skin than talc. The truth is that in many ways talc is a more natural, unadulterated, pure ingredient than bismuth oxychloride. Bismuth oxychloride, which seldom occurs in nature, is manufactured by combining bismuth, a by-product of lead and copper metal refining, with chloride (a chlorine compound) and water. It's used in cosmetics because it has a distinct shimmery, pearlescent appearance and a fine white powder texture that adheres well to skin. Bismuth oxychloride is heavier than talc. Pure bismuth is a naturally occurring, grayish-white powder. It and its derivatives are used as skin protectives, thickeners, and absorbent agents. Bismuth oxychloride was permanently listed by the FDA as a coloring agent in 1977 and for use as a synthetic ingredient.Some people react to bismuth oxychloride due to its unique crystalline structure. What happens is that the crystals can ""poke"" at skin and get stuck in the pores, where the sharper ""spokes"" can cause irritation. This is more of a problem when bismuth oxychloride is the main ingredient in powder makeup.Pure concentrations of bismuth oxychloride nanoparticles appear to have a negative effect on human skin cells.

Any SPF-rated product below SPF 15 can only make a broad spectrum claim that applies to sunburn prevention, not skin aging (wrinkles, brown spots) or skin cancer.The new labeling will also tell consumers on the back of the product that sunscreens labeled as both “Broad Spectrum” and “SPF 15” (or higher) not only protect against sunburn, but, if used as directed with other sun protection measures, can reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. For these broad spectrum products, higher SPF (Sun Protection Factor) values also indicate higher levels of overall protection. By contrast, any sunscreen not labeled as “Broad Spectrum” or that has an SPF value between 2 and 14, has only been shown to help prevent sunburn.Sunscreen products that are not broad spectrum or that are broad spectrum with SPF values from 2 to14 will be labeled with a warning that reads: “Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.

All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

It can penetrate skin and has a constricting effect, which can help improve the look of redness but also may be sensitizing.When it comes to puffy eyes, there is no research indicating caffeine can have any benefit; in fact, research has shown caffeine has an inhibitory action on a key protein in skin that helps it look younger.

Ceramides are necessary for their water-retention capacity and adding them to a skincare product helps provide replenishing and restoring benefits.  Nine different ceramides have been identified in skin, some of which are used in skincare products. On a skincare product ingredient label, you’ll see those listed as ceramide AP, ceramide EOP, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide NS, phytosphingosine, and sphingosine.   The ceramides used in skincare products typically are derived from plants (wheat germ is a common source) or are synthetic; there’s no research showing that either form is preferred over the other.  Ceramides work best for skin when they’re combined with other replenishing ingredients like fatty acids and cholesterol. These lipid mixtures work in multiple ways to improve skin’s texture, suppleness, and help calm signs of sensitivity.   References for this information: Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, October 2014, pages 2473-2483 Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, July 2014, pages 177-184 Journal of Lipid Research, September 2007, pages 1936-1943 American Journal of Clinical Dermatology, Volume 4, 2003, pages 107-129 Journal of Investigative Dermatology, November 2001, pages 1126-1136 Skin Pharmocology and Applied Skin Physiology, September-October 2001, pages 261-271"

Rather, it’s the coolness of it that diminishes puffiness and constricts the skin, and cucumber slices just happen to fit the contours of the eye area.References for this information:International Journal of Toxicology, May 2014, pages 47-67Archives of Dermatological Research, May 2011, pages 247-252Natural Product Research, October 2010, pages 1537-1545"

497,                    dibutyl phthalate                ,"Also known as DBP, it is a common ingredient in nail polish and most synthetic fragrances sold today. It is used as a plasticizer, fragrance stabilizer, and is a key component in giving nail polish its unique properties. The most common mode of exposure, though, is through foods that come into contact with PVC (polyvinylchloride) plastic packaging. Phthalates are also found in countless other products, including building materials, insecticides, nutritional supplements, children’s toys, and automobiles (Source: International Journal of Andrology, February 2006, pages 181–185). In short, it is impossible to completely avoid exposure to phthalates.Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) became controversial when The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals—Results for Mono-butyl phthalate [which is] (metabolized from dibutyl phthalate). The report noted that measurable levels of phthalate were found in the urine of the participants in the study. However, the CDC also stated that “Finding a measurable amount of one or more phthalate metabolites in urine does not mean that the level of one or more phthalates causes an adverse health effect. Whether phthalates at the levels of metabolites reported here are a cause for health concern is not yet known; more research is needed.""Despite the negative association phthalate exposure has in animals, an analysis of multiple studies and epidemiologic research led to the conclusion that “...the risks are low, even lower than originally thought, and that there is no convincing evidence of adverse effects on humans. Since the scientific evidence strongly suggests that risks to humans are low, phthalate regulations that have been enacted are unlikely to lead to any marked improvement in public health.”References for this information:Food Additives and Contaminants, November 2010, pages 1608–1611,1616Risk Analysis, August 2009, issue 8 pages 1170­-1181Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, February 2009, pages 157­–174Environmental Health Perspectives, December 2000, volume 108, issue 12"

538,                    DMAE                ,"DMAE, also known as dimethyl MEA, is a derivative of the B vitamin choline. It has been around for years as an oral supplement that's popularly believed to improve mental alertness, much like Ginkgo biloba and coenzyme Q10. However, the research about DMAE does not show the same positive results as the other two supplements. Because DMAE is chemically similar to choline, DMAE is thought to stimulate production of acetylcholine. And because acetylcholine is a brain neurotransmitter, it's easy to see how it could be associated with brain function. However, only a handful of studies have looked at DMAE for that purpose and they have not been conclusive in the least, while some have shown that DMAE may be problematic or not very effective.It’s a controversial ingredient for skin because research has shown conflicting results. It seems to offer an initial benefit that improves skin firmness, but these results are short-lived and eventually give way to destruction of the substances in skin that help keep it firm. DMAE may also have skin-calming effects.Interestingly, there is a formulation challenge when including DMAE in skincare products. To maintain the efficacy and stability of DMAE, the product’s pH level must be at least 10. A pH of 10 is highly alkaline, which isn’t good news for skin. Moreover, because almost all moisturizers (including serums and eye creams) are formulated with a pH that closely matches that of human skin (generally 5.5–6.5, which is on the acidic side of the scale), in all likelihood the DMAE included in skincare products cannot have any prolonged functionality.References for this information:Pharmazie, December 2009, pages 818-822Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Supplement 72, 2008, pages S17–S22Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, November-December 2007, pages 711–718British Journal of Dermatology, March 2007, pages 433-439American Journal of Clinical Dermatology, Volume 6, 2005, pages 39–47European Journal of Medical Research, May 2003, pages 183–191Mechanisms of Aging and Development, February 1988, pages 129–138"

As a result there is research from that part of the world showing it to be a good emollient that can help restore skin. But along with the evidence that emu oil is a good emollient and the parade of companies promoting it for that, there are also companies promoting products containing emu oil for its antiaging properties.So does emu oil live up to these acclaimed properties? Regrettably, none of these promises are supported by research. A study looked at the ""Cosmetic and moisturizing properties of Emu oil... assessed in a double-blind clinical study. Emu oil in comparison to mineral oil was found overall to be more cosmetically acceptable and had better skin penetration/permeability.""Like many ingredients, it has soothing, emollient properties, but it isn’t the miracle marketers make it out to be.

564,                    environmental damage                ,"Occurrence that takes place at an atomic level and is a complex physiological process. Molecules are comprised of atoms. Atoms comprise all matter. Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons occur in pairs, and when an element only has a few paired electrons it can easily become unstable.Oxygen and oxides are primary examples of potential unstable elements in our environment. When oxygen interacts with skin (and because the air we breathe is 20% oxygen, that happens all the time), it almost always loses one of its electrons. This oxygen molecule, which now is minus one electron, is a damaging environmental factor.Because it is now unstable, the oxygen molecule quickly finds another electron, and it does this by taking an electron from another molecule in the skin, which is usually a healthy substance such as antioxidants in the skin. Antioxidants have lots of electrons to spare. Once those substances are robbed of all their electrons they break down and are destroyed. Oxygen molecules (or other potentially damaging environmental factors) attempting to replenish themselves in this way trigger a cascading event. The reactions that cause environmental damage take place in mere fractions of a second. Antioxidants are substances that prevent oxidative damage from beginning.The primary causes of environmental damage on skin are pollution, air, cigarette smoke, herbicides, and solvents (such as alcohol). Antioxidants are a way to potentially neutralize these effects via topical application."

Sometimes several enzymes are required to carry out a particular  reaction, and their actions are affected by temperature and pH. Some enzymes depend on the presence of other enzymes, called coenzymes, to function, or they depend on a specific body temperature.

All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

For example, “FD&C Blue No. 1–Aluminum Lake” means that the color FD&C Blue No. 1 has been combined with aluminum. Lake colors are used for candies and for dyes used to color Easter eggs, among countless cosmetics applications.The current group of FD&C colors has been extensively studied, with many classified as “permanently approved” for use in drugs and foods. Some FD&C colors, such as Blue 1 and Blue 2, are derivatives of coal tar and can cause allergic reactions, although the amounts used in items such as lipsticks typically are lower than the amounts used for other types of coloring agents. No coal tar colors are permitted in products for use around the eyes, and every batch of coal tar color must be deemed safe before it can be used in foods, drugs, or cosmetics.Any coloring agent used in eye makeup must be specifically approved for that purpose by the FDA.The color of cosmetics products is often an emotional pull for many consumers. A soft pink lotion can denote a moisturizer meant to calm or soothe skin, while a bright yellow balm may be deemed energizing. Whether natural or synthetic, coloring agents in skincare products serve no purpose other than to create a perception or an emotional response to the product.

667,                    gluten ingredients                ,"Gluten is a protein that occurs naturally in many types of grains, including wheat, rye, and barley. As a general group, gluten ingredients include several grains or grain-derived ingredients that are potentially problematic for those diagnosed with a health condition that interferes with the normal digestion of glutens. In this instance, eating gluten-containing foods is ill-advised.The question is whether those with such a health condition or dietary sensitivity should avoid gluten ingredients in cosmetics, and the answer is no. That’s because gluten ingredients cannot get past the skin’s uppermost layers and enter the body (specifically, the digestive system) where they can be troublesome for those with a gluten intolerance. Gluten is simply too big to get into the body via topical application. The exception is applying gluten-containing products to lips, as in these instances some amount of ingestion occurs. Therefore, you’d want to avoid lip balm, gloss, or lipstick/lip color products that contain gluten ingredients.Of course, if you have an allergy to gluten ingredients you’d want to check with your health care provider to determine if the allergy is limited to oral consumption or also includes topical application (assuming you haven’t already determined that topical application of gluten ingredients is a problem for you).If you have a known sensitivity to gluten, avoid products that contain wheat and its derivatives, malt, barley, rye, wheat germ, and oat ingredients.References for this information:Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, September 2012, pages 1,316-1,323www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/gluten-free-skin-and-beauty-products-extracting-cash-from-the-gullible/"

671,                    glycerin                ,"Also called glycerol or glycerine, glycerin is a humectant that’s present in all natural lipids (fats), whether animal or vegetable. It can be derived from natural substances by hydrolysis of fats and by fermentation of sugars; it also can be synthetically manufactured, which is usually the case with modern-day skincare products.Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and skin-restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration. It’s one of the many substances in skin that helps maintain a healthy look and feel, defending against dryness and working to maintain skin’s moisture level. Essentially, glycerin is a master at hydration, and works best when combined with other replenishing and emollient ingredients.Some people wonder whether using products with glycerin takes too much water from skin when there isn’t enough humidity in the air. This can occur with pure glycerin (100% concentration—an amount that’s never used in skincare products). Any humectant (including glycerin) used in pure form can increase water loss by attracting water from the lower layers of skin into the surface layers when the climate is too arid (low humidity). For this reason, glycerin and humectants are typically used in concentrations of 5% or less and always combined with other ingredients to soften skin. In fact, glycerin combined with other emollients and/or oils is a fundamental cornerstone of most moisturizers.

Composed primarily of the sugars fructose and glucose and consumed as food, honey also has applications when it comes to skincare. This is due to its amino acid, peptide, antioxidant, antibacterial composition.  The primary research on honey and skin has to do with its multi-faceted role in soothing various concerns. Dark honeys have a stronger antioxidant effect than light honeys. Regular honey is also known as clarified honey or purified honey.  Honey’s primary use in skincare products is related to its potent antioxidant properties; however, it’s role in helping wounds heal has been shown to have some benefits in comparison to traditional medicines and procedures. Honey forms a barrier on skin that can help soothe and protect.  Manuka is a type of honey that shows up in many skincare products. Often hyped as a special kind of honey, it’s produced in New Zealand from bees that pollinate the country’s native Manuka shrub. Manuka honey is similar to “regular” clover honey except it’s said to contain more of a chemical called methylglyoxal, which might give manuka honey an advantage. Some research shows that it doesn’t necessarily have an edge over other varieties for calming properties and wound healing such as acacia and buckwheat honey.

If you’re struggling with brown spots or skin discolorations, hydroquinone remains among the best ingredient to treat them.A reminder that no skin-lightening ingredient will work to lighten brown spots if you’re not diligent about daily application of a broad spectrum sunscreen.

816,                    isobutylparaben                ,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

The oil form is more likely to aggravate skin than the extract form, especially if you can detect lavender’s distinctive scent.In-vitro research indicates that components of lavender oil, specifically linalool and linalyl acetate, can have damaging effects on skin in as low a concentration as 0.25%. When exposed to air, these components oxidize, meaning their potential for causing a reaction increases. If you’re wondering why lavender oil doesn’t appear to be problematic for some people, it’s because research has demonstrated that you don’t always need to immediately see or feel the sensitizing effects for your skin to suffer damage.

Unlike glycolic acid, mandelic acid is light-sensitive and must be packaged in an opaque container to remain effective.  A couple studies have shown that mandelic acid and salicylic acid worked well together in a higher-strength peel for use on darker skin tones struggling with discolorations, including post-acne marks. However, what we don’t know is how well mandelic acid would’ve worked on its own—it’s possible the results were more from salicylic acid than the combination of the two acids.

1009,                    methylparaben                ,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

1064,                    niacinamide                ,"Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a very effective skin-restoring ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Among these benefits is the ability to visibly improve the appearance of enlarged pores, uneven skin tone, fine lines, dullness, and a weakened skin surface. Niacinamide can also mitigate the damage environmental attack can cause, and is stable in the presence of heat and light.    What about using vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and niacinamide in the same product or applied at the same time in separate products?   You might have read or heard that niacinamide and vitamin C shouldn’t be used at the same time, whether found together in the same product or applied separately one after the other. Rest assured, this combination is fine and is in fact quite beneficial!     The research this misconception is based on was conducted in the 1960s; the forms of niacinamide and vitamin C used in this study were not stabilized—although niacinamide itself is very stable. The base of the formula used in this study was also far different than today’s sophisticated skincare formulas. Today, cosmetic chemists know how to combine niacinamide and vitamin C in the ideal base formulas that enhance their compatibility.     The other common concern we’ve seen about combining these two ingredients has to do with the pH range. The concern is that the acidic environment ascorbic acid needs to be most effective will cause niacinamide will convert to nicotinic acid, a form that can be sensitizing, possibly inducing redness. Good news: This conversion process would only happen under conditions of the formula being exposed to very high heat for a long period of time. This would not apply to layering skincare products or to heat conditions that occur during manufacturing, transport, and storage of cosmetic products that contain niacinamide and ascorbic acid.What all of this means is that you can use or layer products containing both niacinamide and vitamin C knowing that they will not render each other any less effective. Each of these ingredients on its own can help to address dark spots, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, loss of firmness, and dullness. When used together, they become even more of a powerhouse! This duo will help give you an even better chance at achieving a radiant, smooth, even, younger-looking complexion. We take a deeper dive into this topic in this article.

There are no studies that demonstrate octinoxate, when and as used in SPF products, is harmful. In the sole studies cited when such claims are made, the conditions are completely inapplicable to how sunscreen ingredients are used in skincare products. For example, such “studies” use extremely high concentrations of octinoxate (much higher than would ever be used in sunscreens) or even fed to lab animals. There simply isn’t any research backing the claim that octinoxate has any link to health risks when used in sunscreen formulas. In fact, the European Union’s permitted usage level for octinoxate in sunscreens is higher than the maximum amount permitted in the United States (7.5% in the United States, 10% in the EU).References for this information:Pharmazie, 2013, issue 1, pages 34-40Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, 2005, issue 4, pages170-174"

Its safety in sunscreens is well established.As a group, the benzophenones are used not only for sun protection but also as photostabilizers in cosmetics products. That means they keep products from turning color or from degrading in the presence of sunlight. They also have other uses, including flavor enhancers in food.Oxybenzone is sometimes called out as a sunscreen active that is damaging to undersea coral reefs, the theory being that the sunscreen gets into the water from human activity in the oceans. However, despite research showing oxybenzone negatively impacts coral components in vitro (meaning in a lab setting), there doesn’t seem to be conclusive causation in a marine environment, especially given the numerous other factors, including climate change, believed to be responsible for the loss of coral reefs. The Personal Care Products Council looked at the research and concluded the following: ““Degradation of the world’s coral reefs is a serious concern. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Conservation Program, coral reefs are threatened by an increasing array of impacts – primarily from global climate change, unsustainable fishing and other factors. There is no scientific evidence that under naturally-occurring conditions, sunscreen ingredients, which have been safely used around the world for decades, are contributing to this issue.”References for this information:Archives of Environmental Containment and Toxicology, February 2016, pages 265-288Photodermatology, Photoimmunology, and Photomedicine, 2011, pages 58-67Archives of Dermatology, July 2011 pages 865-866European Commission Directorate General for Health and Consumers.

1141,                    parabens                ,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet.

Skin is composed primarily of a protein known as keratin, so peptides have a role to play as part of a complete skincare routine—though as with any anti-aging ingredient, it’s important to keep your expectations realistic!Ongoing research has shown that all peptides have some amount of skin-restorative ability, assuming the formulation supports the type of peptide used and is packaged to protect it from degrading from light and air exposure during use (no jars!).Ironically, peptides can become unstable in water-based formulas. Further, because peptides are vulnerable to attack by enzymes, the abundant enzymes present in skin can break the peptides down to the point where they have no effect. Knowledge of these inherent weaknesses has led many ingredient manufacturing companies to produce synthetic peptides engineered to be more stable on and within skin. Such peptides can survive intact on skin and better reach their target areas—so you’ll see anti-aging benefits!Some peptides have demonstrated a remarkable skin-soothing effect, while others can improve the appearance of wrinkles, loss of firmness, and even help to soften the look of expression lines.Don’t get seduced by the notion that there’s a best peptide or peptide blend because there isn’t. There are dozens and dozens of remarkable peptides and more being discovered (or made in a lab) every day. Just like antioxidants, skin-soothing ingredients, and skin-replenishing ingredients, there a dozens of brilliant peptides. When all of these elements are combined in a skincare product to address multiple signs of aging, they can do amazing things!But despite claims to the contrary, peptides cannot plump lips (at least not to a noticeable extent), stop sagging skin, work just like cosmetic corrective procedures, or eliminate dark circles or puffy eyes. You’ll see all of these claims and more on products with peptides, but such claims are not supported by published, peer-reviewed research.

1199,                    phenoxyethanol                ,"Phenoxyethanol is a widely used synthetic preservative that has global approval for use in all cosmetic products in concentrations up to 1%. It’s often used in even lower amounts, such as when combined with other ingredients like ethylhexylglycerin. In this case, lower amounts of phenoxyethanol can be just as effective as the maximum approved amount.Phenoxyethanol is incredibly versatile: It works in a large range of formulas and pH ranges, has broad spectrum activity against many pathogens you don’t want multiplying in your skincare products, is stable, and is compatible with many other preservatives used in cosmetics.Phenoxyethanol has become the new skincare ingredient to be demonized by various retail/natural marketing cosmetic companies and websites. The controversy is similar to the absurdity over paraben preservatives. Parabens were made evil in skincare products because of studies showing they are endocrine disruptors, but parabens don’t have that property when they absorb into skin. Much like parabens, phenoxyethanol being a problem in cosmetics is based on research that has nothing to do with skincare. The negative research about phenoxyethanol is not about the cosmetics-grade version. That’s a big difference. Even plant extracts have to be purified when they are removed from the ground and put into skincare products. No one wants worms, fertilizer, heavy metals, and dirt in their products. Phenoxyethanol is the same situation, it is purified before it is used in cosmetic formulations.As with many cosmetic ingredients, concentration matters. A 100% concentration of phenoxyethanol comes with some scary warnings. For example, the Safety Data Sheet on this preservative describes it as harmful if it contacts skin, is inhaled, or gets in to the eyes. Animal studies have shown it causes reproductive and developmental toxicity—no wonder some panic is occurring! As it turns out, the animal studies were about mice being fed large doses of this preservative, not about it being applied to skin, absorbing, and then causing reproductive or developmental harm. If you fed mice mass amounts of lavender or other essential oils, they would suffer terrible consequences.The rest of the alarming studies are about using phenoxyethanol in full-strength or atypically high concentrations, not the amounts of 1% or less used in cosmetic products. Think of it as the difference between taking one sip of wine versus chugging several bottles at once!Back to topical use, research has shown that compared to many other preservatives, the incidence of a sensitized or allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol applied as used in cosmetics is rare. But the truth is all preservatives, even the natural ones, carry some risk of sensitizing skin. That’s because preservatives of any kind are meant to kill fungus, bacteria, and mold and that can negatively impact skin. Ironically, in order for natural preservatives to be effective, they have to be used in much higher amounts than synthetic preservatives, typically up to 10%. This higher amount poses irritation and sensitizing problems for skin, so natural preservatives aren’t a slam-dunk replacement for synthetics, not even close.An interesting factoid: although the phenoxyethanol used in skincare products is synthetic, this chemical occurs naturally in green tea, just like parabens occur naturally in berries and other natural foods.References for this information:Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, December 2016, page 156PLOS One, October 2016, ePublicationJournal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, June 2015, pages 1,071-1,081Cosmetics & Toiletries, 2014, issue 5, pages 24-27International Journal of Cosmetic Science, April 2011, issue 2, pages 190-196"

Until more research comes to light, this isn’t an ingredient to bank on for great results if an uneven skin tone is your concern; however, it’s fine to use in products that also contain other skin-brightening ingredients with established track records of success.References Cited:Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, March 2013, issue 1, pages 12-17"

Those that are considered to be potential risks are not approved for use in consumer packaging were banned in the US as well as the EU (these are phthalates DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP). Just to be clear, these have never been used in personal care products to begin with, rather they are used for industrial products.However, those phthalates that have proven to be safe are not banned in the US or EU (DEP, for example, AKA diethyl phthalate is used in the EU in packaging for personal care products and other consumer items, and was given broad approval of safety in 2007.The EU (Scientific Committee on Consumer Products) did a thorough and detailed degree of research of prior and new research and found that there was no plausible risk from what trace amounts exist in packaging for personal care products.An earlier study in 2001 in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology already arrived at this conclusion so far as the risk of DEP in personal care products.What is often cited as a risk by crusaders is either phthalates that are not present in personal care, food or medical device packaging materials (therefore not applicable) or studies that utilize massive doses of a type of types of phthalates (beyond what would be possible in humans).Bisphenol A (BPA) is sometimes confused with phthalates, but is a completely unrelated substance. Either way, BPA also has been demonstrated, exhaustively, to be safe for use in packaging for food or cosmetics. In 2007, the EU found them safe. In 2009, a study published in Critical Reviews in Toxicology found that BPA poses no risk from to humans. In 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the FDA found (repeatedly) that BPA is safe as used in packaging for food and cosmetics.References for this information:U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

They’re supposed to be as effective as AHAs, but less sensitizing. Gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are chemically and functionally similar to AHAs (such as glycolic acid). The significant difference between them and AHAs is that gluconolactone and lactobionic acid have larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate the skin, resulting in less potential for sensitizing side-effects. Supposedly, this reduced absorption into the skin does not hamper their effectiveness. Does that mean gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are better for your skin than AHAs in the form of glycolic acid or lactic acid? According to an Internet-published class lecture by Dr. Mark G. Rubin, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Diego, research on gluconolactone demonstrated only a “6% decrease in dermal penetration” in comparison to glycolic acid, which “isn’t a dramatic improvement.” Gluconolactone may be slightly less sensitizing for some skin types, but this isn’t the magic bullet for exfoliation some cosmetics companies have been extolling. Polyhydroxy acids can also function as antioxidants and may promote some amount of improvement in skin’s surface strength.References for this information:Clinics in Dermatology, September-October 2009, pages 495-501Cutis, February 2004, Supplement, pages 3-13"

Even water and salt have frightening comments regarding their safety according to their MSDS reports. In cosmetics, propylene glycol is used in small amounts to keep products from melting in high heat or from freezing. It also helps active ingredients penetrate skin.

All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet.

However, most of the research dates back to 1990 and earlier. Prior to and even after pycnogenol was trademarked, it was used freely as a generic term for procyanidins. Procyanidins (also known as proanthocyanidins) are pigments belonging to the flavonoid family of ingredients.

1351,                    retinol                ,"Name for the entire vitamin A molecule. Retinol is a powerhouse ingredient that has value for skin on several fronts: It’s a skin-restoring, wrinkle-smoothing, firming ingredient and an antioxidant, allowing it to improve a variety of skin concerns, most related to visible signs of aging.  Packaging is a key issue, so any container that lets in air (like jar packaging) or sunlight (clear containers) just won’t cut it. Lots of retinol products come in unacceptable packaging; these should be avoided because the retinol will most likely be (or quickly become) ineffective. Look for opaque, airless, or air-restrictive packaging.  Many consumers are concerned about the percentage of retinol in anti-aging products such as serums or moisturizers. Although the percentage can make a difference (especially if it’s too low), it’s not helpful in understanding how a retinol product will benefit your skin. Far more important is the delivery system, packaging, and the other ingredients present with the retinol.   Using a product with a range of anti-aging ingredients plus retinol is far more valuable for skin than using a product with only a supposedly high percentage of retinol. Skin needs far more than any one ingredient can provide, however great that one ingredient may be. See our article on this topic for detailed information.  There are several myths about using retinol with other anti-aging ingredients or products, such as those with vitamin C or exfoliants like glycolic acid. See our article on this topic to learn what the research has shown to be true.

Research has shown it to be an effective antioxidant when applied to skin. You may be surprised to learn that retinyl palmitate is found naturally in our skin, where it works as an antioxidant, particularly in regard to helping protect skin from UV light exposure—though it does not replace the need for sunscreen. Reports that retinyl palmitate is not a safe ingredient are false. They’re based on a study from nearly 20 years ago that has never been reproduced or tested under real-life conditions such as how people use sunscreens that contain this ingredient. In addition, to date, there is no scientific evidence that retinyl palmitate is a carcinogen in humans.  The safety of retinyl palmitate is supported by several accredited organizations and their opinions are widely available online.

Retinyl retinoate has been shown, in limited but promising research (most coming from the same team of Korea-based researchers), to be less sensitizing than retinoic acid (prescription-strength) and cosmetic retinol. Retinyl retinoate may be less sensitizing than pure retinol because of its slower conversion in skin to retinoic acid. However, when it comes to sensitivity from retinol, there’s much that can be done using time-release delivery systems and ingredient additions to maximize its benefits to skin while minimizing, if not eliminating, its risk of sensitivity.Although there’s reason to consider retinyl retinoate if your skin seems intolerant of cosmetic retinol, it shouldn’t be construed as better or safer for skin than such alternatives.References for this information:Dermatology Research and Practice, 2010Cutis, October 2008, issue 4, pages 281-284The Chemistry and Manufacture of Cosmetics.

1449,                    silicone                ,"Substance derived from silica (sand is a silica). The unique fluid properties of silicone give it a great deal of slip, and in its various forms it can feel like silk on skin, impart emollience, and be a water-binding agent that holds up well, even when skin becomes wet. The research about silicones have proven them to be superior scar-healing ingredients, soothing agents, non-irritating, and uniquely effective delivery and suspending agents for a wide range of cosmetic ingredients. There are numerous forms of silicones used in cosmetic products, particularly leave-on skincare products and all manner of hair-care products. Common forms of silicone are cyclopentasiloxane and cyclohexasiloxane; other forms include various types of dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone.Claims that silicones in any form cause or  worsen skin concerns have not been substantiated in any published research, nor have reports that silicones are sensitizing to or somehow “suffocate” skin. In fact, just the opposite is true which makes the misinformation difficult to understand. Almost all of the claims about silicones being problematic for skin are apparently myths or based on anecdotal evidence.Because of silicone’s unique molecular properties, they are at the same time porous and resistant though not impermeable to air. Think of silicones in a skincare formula like the covering of a tea bag. When you steep the tea bag in water the tea and all of its antioxidant properties are released into the water. Silicones remain on the surface of your skin and the other ingredients it’s mixed with “steep” through. All ingredients must be suspended in some base formula; some of the ingredients remain on the surface, some are absorbed. The intent is for the “actives” to get through. The special molecular structure of silicones (large molecules with wide spaces between each molecule) allows them to form a permeable barrier and also explains why silicones rarely feel heavy or occlusive, although they still offer protection against moisture loss.Interestingly, silicone has been shown to be helpful for offsetting dryness and flaking from common ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide.Bottom line: The types of silicones used in cosmetic products are supported by scientific research and are considered safe for consumer use. These types of cosmetic silicones are effective, inert, and versatile ingredients that benefit skin and hair in numerous ways.References for this information:International Journal of Pharmaceuticals, March 2017, pages 158-162Molecular Therapy, June 2017, pages 1342-1352 Plastic Reconstructive Surgery Global, December 2016, e1183 Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, December 2016, pages 13-20 Frontiers in Pharmacology, May 2015, ePublication International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding, May-June 2015, pages 223-230 International Journal of Toxicology, May-June 2013, pages 5S-24S Dermatology Research and Practice, October 2010, ePublication Cutis, October 2008, pages 218-284 http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulating/category/antiaging/34408409.html"

1567,                    sulfates                ,"In cosmetics, this large group of ingredients is used mainly as cleansing agents in skincare and hair-care products; they include sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and sodium laureth sulfate. Many consumers are concerned of sulfates in their cosmetics products because of widespread misinformation. Sulfates are not a problem, but once organizations and companies build up fears among consumers about certain cosmetics ingredients there’s almost no going back, the damage is done.In reality there’s absolutely no research showing that sulfates are a problem in skincare or hair-care products, other than causing sensitivity, but that is also true for the sulfate-free cleansing agents that some cosmetics companies advertise and sell. And, whether or not a cleansing agent will cause sensitivity depends on the amount of sulfate and on other ingredients present in a specific formula.Following are some of the most typical unsupported comments about sulfates: “Sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers are better for hair and skin.” No research has shown that to be even remotely the case. Sulfates are supposed to be terribly drying and damaging to hair, when in fact they function no differently from the cleansing agents in sulfate-free shampoos. Almost every company that touts the fact that they don’t contain sulfates do use detergent cleansing agents such as sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamidopropylamine oxide, and sodium methyl 2-sulfolaurate.Why those are supposedly any better for skin is never explained, and no research is ever cited—because none exists. Sometimes these companies list those ingredients as being derived from or coming from coconut to make them sound natural and, by association, better for skin—but they all end up being primarily synthetic. That doesn’t make them bad in any way; it’s just that the claims are completely disingenuous. What you need to know is that both the sulfate-free cleansing agents and the sulfate versions can be drying and sensitizing depending on the formulation and/or your skin’s own reaction. All of these cleansing agents remove oil and the gunk from styling products, which is exactly what a shampoo should do.“Sulfates in cleansers are cheap.” This one is true, but so what? Lots of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, are cheap, others are expensive, which has absolutely nothing to do with quality or efficacy. The first ingredient in sulfate-free shampoos is water (about 90% water) and no other cosmetic ingredient is cheaper than that!“Sulfates are used in floor cleaners and are corrosive.” This can be true, when used in large amounts and when left on surfaces over time, but so what? Salt is used to melt ice on the roadway, but it also rusts cars, which doesn’t make salt bad; it just depends on how much you use and how long you leave it on something. This is also true for the alternative sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers as well; they can also be corrosive over time depending on how much is used and how long it is left on.“Sulfates can be sensitizing.” This can absolutely be true, but again, so what? As a general category, sulfates are not sensitizing when used in appropriate amounts in shampoos and cleansers and the same is true for sulfate-free alternative cleansing agents. All of the research about sulfates being sensitizing are from patch tests where a concentration is left on skin under a bandage for 24 hours, which is not how a cleanser or shampoo is used. Sodium lauryl sulfate is considered one of the more sensitizing cleansing agents and we recommend avoiding it when it is high up on the ingredient list, but that’s NOT because it’s a sulfate; rather, it’s because of its interaction with skin."

However, the amount  present in most skincare products is usually less than 1%, as higher amounts  impart a strong scent many people find intolerable, not to mention these higher  amounts increase tea tree oil’s potential to sensitize and redden skin.Careful use and storage of tea tree oil is advised;  like all plant oils, it should be protected from routine exposure to light and  air.

It protects skin from UVA and UVB radiation and is considered no risk of skin sensitivity. Because its gentle, titanium dioxide is a great sunscreen active for sensitive, redness-prone skin. It’s great for use around the eyes, as it is highly unlikely to cause stinging.  Titanium dioxide is typically micronized and coated for use in cosmetics products. The micronizing makes this somewhat heavy-feeling ingredient easier to spread on skin, plus a bit more cosmetically elegant. Micronized titanium dioxide is much more stable and can provide better sun protection than non-micronized titanium dioxide. Micronized titanium dioxide doesn't penetrate skin so there’s no need to be concerned about it getting into your body. Even when titanium dioxide nanoparticles are used, the molecular size of the substance used to coat the nanoparticles is large enough to prevent them from penetrating beyond the uppermost layers of skin. This means you’re getting the sun protection titanium dioxide provides with no risk of it causing harm to skin or your body.  The coating process improves application, enhances sun protection, and prevents the titanium dioxide from interacting with other ingredients in the presence of sunlight, thus enhancing its stability. It not only makes this ingredient much more pleasant to use for sunscreen, but also improves efficacy and eliminates safety concerns. Common examples of ingredients used to coat titanium dioxide are alumina, dimethicone, silica, and trimethoxy capryl silane.    Titanium dioxide as used in sunscreens is commonly modified with other ingredients to ensure efficacy and stability. Examples of what are known as surface modifier ingredients used for titanium dioxide include stearic acid, isostearic acid, polyhydroxystearic acid, and dimethicone/methicone copolymer.    Some websites maintain titanium dioxide is inferior to zinc oxide, another mineral sunscreen whose core characteristics are similar to those of titanium dioxide. The reality is titanium dioxide is a great broad-spectrum SPF ingredient and is widely used in all manner of sun-protection products. What gets confusing for some consumers is trying to decipher research that ranks sunscreen ingredients by a UV spectrum graph. By most standards, broad-spectrum coverage for sunscreen ingredients is defined as one that surpasses 360 nanometers (abbreviated as “nm” - how the sun’s rays are measured). Titanium dioxide exceeds this range of protection, but depending on whose research you read, it either performs as well as or slightly below zinc oxide.    It’s true that titanium dioxide does not rank as high for UVA protection as zinc oxide, it ends up being a small difference (think about it like being 10 years old versus 10 years and 3 months old). This is not easily understood in terms of other factors affecting how sunscreen actives perform (such as the base formula), so many, including some dermatologists, assume that zinc oxide is superior to titanium dioxide for UVA protection. When carefully formulated, titanium dioxide provides excellent UVA protection. Its UVA protection peak is lower than that of zinc oxide, but both continue to provide protection throughout the UVA range for the same amount of time.

UVA rays have wavelengths of 320 to 400 nanometers; UVB rays have wavelengths of 290 to 320 nanometers. UVB radiation causes sunburn, while UVA radiation does not produce any visible short-term evidence of skin damage. Nonetheless, UVA radiation creates serious cumulative changes in skin that may be far greater than the sunburn caused by UVB radiation. Research has shown that unprotected exposure to UVA rays can, within one week, create distinct injury. Research also indicates UVA exposure is even more damaging than we once knew: it seems that when UVA radiation hits skin, it not only penetrates to skin’s lower layers but the damage “bounces back” like light reflecting from a mirror, giving every layer of your skin a double-whammy of damage. UVA radiation prompts tanning, yes, but the tan you see is direct evidence of your skin responding, as best it can, to the onslaught of damage it just endured.To be truly effective and beneficial for skin, sunscreens must protect skin from both the sun’s UVA and UVB radiation. In the United States, there are four ingredients approved by the FDA that protect across the full UVA range: titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, avobenzone (also called Parsol 1789 and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane)."

This type of vitamin K is also referred to as vitamin K1.A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology (April 2004, page 73) examined the effect of applying a gel containing 2% vitamin K plus 0.1% retinol, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Fifty-seven adults with dark circles participated in this 8-week study and the results, while not a slam-dunk, weren't exactly discouraging either: 47% of the testers noted ""fair to moderate"" improvement in their dark circles. The majority of testers noticed no change, but the ingredient was well-tolerated. As encouraging as this seems, whether or not the results were from the vitamin K or the other vitamins is unknown.A minimum 1% concentration of vitamin K1 has been shown in animal studies to positively influence wound healing by hastening the natural process damaged skin undergoes as it works to repair itself. It is not known if this principle would apply to intact skin showing signs of aging. The same concentration of vitamin K1 was used in another study to test its results on improving the look of dark circles. Although some improvement was noted, the formula in testing also contained caffeine and emu oil, although the study’s authors concluded that the dark circle benefits were solely attributed to vitamin K.Interestingly, despite somewhat encouraging research, we rarely see products that contain (or are likely to contain) the amounts of vitamin K research has shown can be beneficial.References for this information:Advanced Biomedical Research, January 2015, ePublicationIndian Journal of Pharmacology, July-August 2014, pages 409-412Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery, July-September 2012, pages 176-182"

Despite claims of skin’s need for hydration and claims regarding special types of water, it turns out that water may not be an important ingredient for skin. Only a 10% concentration of water in the outer layer of skin is necessary for softness and pliability in this part of the epidermis. Studies that have compared the water content of dry skin with that of normal or oily skin do not find a statistically significant difference in moisture levels between them.Further, too much water can be a problem for skin because it can disrupt the essential substances in skin's surface layers that keep it intact, smooth, and healthy-looking. As an example, recall how skin on your fingers and toes ""prunes"" when you soak in the bathtub or other body of water for too long.References for this information:Skin Research and Technology, May 2015, pages 131-136Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, November-December 1999, pages 344-351Journal of Cosmetic Science, September-October 1993, pages 249-262"

However, witch hazel’s high tannin content (tannin is a potent antioxidant) can also make it sensitizing if used repeatedly on skin. The bark of the witch hazel plant has a higher tannin content than the leaves. Producing witch hazel water by steam distillation removes the tannins, but the plant’s astringent qualities are what most believe give it benefit.Alcohol is added during the distillation process, the amount typically being 14–15%. Witch hazel water is distilled from all parts of the plant; therefore, you never know exactly what you’re getting, although the alcohol content remains.Depending on the form of witch hazel, you’re exposing your skin either to an sensitizing amount of alcohol or to tannins, or both.
