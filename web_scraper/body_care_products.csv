PPAR Activators begin healing by penetrating the skin to replenish lipids and boost skins natural renewal cycle.  Micro-droplets of Vaseline Jelly form a protective layer on the surface of skin to prevent moisture loss.  Elastomers are then added to deliver the luxurious silky, smooth product feel.
